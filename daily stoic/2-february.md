## Passions and emotions

### 1st FEB => FOR THE HOT-HEADED MAN

- Strength is the ability to maintain a hold of oneself. 
- Strength is being the person who never gets mad, who cannot be rattled, 
   because they are in control of
   their passions—rather than "controlled by" their passions.
   
 ### 2nd FEB => A PROPER FRAME OF MIND
 
 - We would never let another person jerk us around the way we let our
  impulses do. It’s time we start seeing it that way — that we’re not puppets
  that can be made to dance this way or that way just because we feel like it.
  
 - We should be the ones in control, not our emotions, because we are
  independent, self-sufficient people.
  
### 3rd FEB => THE SOURCE OF YOUR ANXIETY

outside their reasoned choice”

### 6th FEB => DON’T SEEK OUT STRIFE

distraction.

- The combination of power, fear, and mania can be deadly.

### 8th FEB => DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

- The next time someone gets upset near you—crying, yelling, breaking
something, being pointed or cruel—watch how quickly this statement
will stop them cold: “I hope this is making you feel better.”

### 9th FEB => YOU DON’T HAVE TO HAVE AN OPINION

- “We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not let
it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power to

### 10th FEB => ANGER IS BAD FUEL

### 11th FEB => HERO OR NERO?

### 12th FEB => PROTECT YOUR PEACE OF MIND

- Don’t be afraid to make a change—a big one

### 13th FEB -> PLEASURE CAN BECOME PUNISHMENT

- “Whenever you get an impression of some pleasure, as with any
impression, guard yourself from being carried away by it, let it
await your action, give yourself a pause. 
- After that, bring to mind
both times, first when you have enjoyed the pleasure and later
when you will regret it and hate yourself. 
- Then compare to those the joy and satisfaction you’d feel for abstaining altogether.
- However, if a seemingly appropriate time arises to act on it, don’t
be overcome by its comfort, pleasantness, and allure—but against
all of this, how much better the consciousness of conquering it.”
—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION.

happiness here and now.

### 18th FEB => PREPARE FOR THE STORM

- When it comes to your goals and the things you strive for, ask yourself:
Am I in control of them or they in control of me?
 
 ### 22nd FEB => WHAT’S BETTER LEFT UNSAID
 
 - It’s easy to act—to just dive in. It’s harder to stop, to pause, to think: No,
I’m not sure I need to do that yet. I’m not sure I am ready.

### 23rd FEB => CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE NO CARE FOR OUR FEELINGS

- “You shouldn’t give circumstances the power to rouse anger, for
they don’t care at all.”

### 25th FEB => THE SMOKE AND DUST OF MYTH

### 26th FEB => TO EACH HIS OWN

common nature has willed, and what I endeavor to accomplish
now is what my nature wills.”

### 27th FEB => CULTIVATING INDIFFERENCE WHERE OTHERS GROW
PASSION

### 28th FEB => WHEN YOU LOSE CONTROL

- “The soul is like a bowl of water, and our impressions are like the
ray of light falling upon the water. When the water is troubled, it
appears that the light itself is moved too, but it isn’t. So, when a
person loses their composure it isn’t their skills and virtues that
are troubled, but the spirit in which they exist, and when that spirit
calms down so do those things.”

### 29th FEB => YOU CAN’T ALWAYS (BE) GET(TING) WHAT YOU WANT

- we can have it all” is the mantra of our modern lives. Work, family, purpose, success, leisure time—
we want all of this, at the same time (right now, to boot).
- “Don’t set your heart on so many things.” 
-  Focus. Prioritize. 
-  Train your mind to ask: Do I need this thing? What will happen if I do not get it
Can I make do without it?
- The answers to these questions will help you relax, help you cut out all the needless things 
that make you busy—too busy to be balanced or happy.
