## Awareness
### 1st MARCH => WHERE PHILOSOPHY BEGINS

- we begin our journey into
philosophy when we become aware of the ability to analyze our own minds.

### 2nd MARCH => ACCURATE SELF-ASSESSMENT
- “Above all, it is necessary for a person to have a true self-estimate, for we commonly think 
we can do more than we really can.”
- it is a great failing “to see yourself as more than you are
- it is equally damaging to “value yourself at less than your true worth.”

### 3rd MARCH => (DIS)INTEGRATION

- We’re all complicated people. We have multiple sides to ourselves— conflicting wants, desires, and fears. 
- The outside world is no less confusing and contradictory. If we’re not careful, 
all these forces—pushing and pulling—will eventually tear us apart.
- If we do not focus on our internal integration—on self-awareness—werisk external disintegration.

### 4th MARCH => AWARENESS IS FREEDOM

- Often powerful people are slaves to their money, to their positions, to their mistresses
- We see this slavery all the time, question is "Are you as free as you think?"

### 5th MARCH => CUTTING BACK ON THE COSTLY

- “So, concerning the things we pursue, and for which we vigorously
exert ourselves, we owe this consideration—either there is nothing
useful in them, or most aren’t useful. Some of them are
superfluous, while others aren’t worth that much. But we don’t
discern this and see them as free, when they cost us dearly.”

- Even what we get for free has a cost, if only in what we pay
to store it—in our garages and in our minds. 

- As you walk past your
possessions today, ask yourself: Do I need this? Is it superfluous? What’s
this actually worth? What is it costing me?

- You might be surprised by the answers and how much we’ve been
paying without even knowing it.

### 6th MARCH => DON’T TELL YOURSELF STORIES

- “In public avoid talking often and excessively about your
accomplishments and dangers, for however much you enjoy
recounting your dangers, it’s not so pleasant for others to hear
about your affairs.”

- “Narrative Fallacy” — The tendency to assemble unrelated events of the past into stories.
- Try your best not to create this fantasy bubble—live in what’s real.
- Listen and connect with people, don’t perform for them.

### 7th MARCH => DON’T TRUST THE SENSES

- Because our senses are often wrong, our emotions overly alarmed, our
projections overly optimistic, we’re better off not rushing into conclusions
about anything. 
- We can take a beat with everything we do and become
aware of everything that’s going on,so we can make the right decision.


### 8th MARCH => DON’T UNINTENTIONALLY HAND OVER YOUR FREEDOM

- “If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be
furious. Yet you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along,
so they may abuse you, leaving it disturbed and troubled—have
you no shame in that?”


### 9th MARCH => FIND THE RIGHT SCENE

- “You are the average of the five people
you spend the most time with.”

- Ask yourself about the people you meet and spend time with: Are
they making me better? Do they encourage me to push forward and hold me
accountable? Or do they drag me down to their level? Now, with this in
mind, ask the most important question: Should I spend more or less time
with these folks?

### 10th MARCH =>  FIND YOURSELF A CATO

- Cato—a great and noble person we can allow into our minds 
 and use to guide our actions, even when they’re not physically present.
- Who can stand and witness to our behavior. 
- Someone who can quietly admonish us if we are
considering doing something lazy, dishonest, or selfish.
- And if we do it right, and live our lives in such a way, perhaps we can
serve as someone else’s Cato or indifferent spectator when they need it.

### 11th MARCH => LIVING WITHOUT RESTRICTION

- “The unrestricted person, who has in hand what they will in all
events, is free. But anyone who can be restricted, coerced, or
pushed into something against what they will is a slave.”

- “Slavery resides under marble and gold.” Too
many successful people are prisoners in jails of their own making. Is that
what you want? Is that what you’re working hard toward? Let’s hope not.

### 12th MARCH => SEEING THINGS AS THE PERSON AT FAULT DOES

- Nobody thinks they’re wrong, even when they are.

### 13th MARCH => ONE DAY IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE
“Part of the reason we fight against the things that happen is that we’re so
focused on our plan that we forget that there might be a bigger plan we
don’t know about.”

### 14th MARCH => SELF-DECEPTION IS OUR ENEMY

- “It is impossible for a person to begin to learn what
he thinks he already knows.” 

- Today, we will be unable to improve, unable to learn, unable to earn the 
respect of others if we think we’re already
perfect, a genius admired far and wide. 

- In this sense, ego and self-deception
are the enemies of the things we wish to have because we delude ourselves
into believing that we already possess them.

### 15th MARCH => THE PRESENT IS ALL WE POSSESS

- Today, notice how often you look for more.That is, wanting the past to
be more than what it was.or wanting
the future to unfold exactly as you expect (with hardly a thought as to how
that might affect other people).
- When you do this, you’re neglecting the present moment.

### 16th MARCH => THAT SACRED PART OF YOU

- The fact that you can think, the fact that you can read this book, the fact
that you are able to reason in and out of situations — all of this is what
gives you the ability to improve your circumstances and become better. 

- It’s important to appreciate this ability, because it’s a genuine ability. Not everyone is so lucky.

- Seriously, what you take for granted, others wouldn’t even think to
dream of.

- Take a little time today to remember that you’re blessed with the
capacity to use logic and reason to navigate situations and circumstances.

- This gives you unthinkable power to alter your circumstances and the
circumstances of others. 

- And remember that with power comes responsibility.

### 17th MARCH => THE BEAUTY OF CHOICE

- It’s easy to confuse the image we present to the world for who we
actually are, especially when media messaging deliberately blurs that
distinction.

- Not how things appear, but what effort, activity, and choices they are a result of.

### 18th MARCH => IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT

- We can’t blame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated 
any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us. 

### 19th MARCH => TIMELESS WISDOM

- “The cause of my irritation is not in this person but in me.”

- The cause of our notion that something is bad : that
comes from us, from our labels or our expectations. 
- Just as easily, we can change those labels; 
we can change our entitlement and decide to accept
and love what’s happening around us.

### 20th MARCH => READY AND AT HOME

- We’d be crazy to want to face
difficulty in life. But we’d be equally crazy to pretend that it isn’t going to
happen. 

- Which is why when it knocks on our door — as it very well may this
morning — let’s make sure we’re prepared to answer!

### 21st MARCH => THE BEST RETREAT IS IN HERE, NOT OUT THERE

- Are you looking forward to the weekend so you can have some peace and quiet? 
- Maybe, you think, after things settle down or after I get this over with. 
- But how often has that ever actually worked?

- “Wherever you go, there you are.”

### 22nd MARCH => THE SIGN OF TRUE EDUCATION

- You don’t need to step into a classroom to understand the basic, 
fundamental reality of nature and of our proper role in it. 

- Begin with awareness and reflection. Not just once,
but every single second of every single day.

### 23rd MARCH => THE STRAITJACKETED SOUL

- It’s better to look at how greed and vices might be having a similar effect in
your own life. What lapses in judgment might your vices be causing you?
What “sicknesses” might you have?

- And how can your rational mind step in and regulate them?

### 24th MARCH => THERE IS PHILOSOPHY IN EVERYTHING

- Epictetus means about the study of Philosophy. Study, yes,
but go live your life as well. It’s the only way that you’ll actually
understand whether you took any of the teachings to heart.

- Be aware of that today when you’re going to work, going on a date,
deciding whom to vote for, calling your parents in the evening, waving to
your neighbor as you walk to your door, tipping the delivery man, saying
goodnight to someone you love. All of that is philosophy. All of it is
experience that brings meaning to the words.

### 25th MARCH => WEALTH AND FREEDOM ARE FREE

- “. . . freedom isn’t secured by filling up on your heart’s desire but
by removing your desire.”

### 26th MARCH => WHAT RULES YOUR RULING REASON?

- Roman satirist Juvenal is famous for this question "Who watches the watchmen?"
- Learn what underpins this philosophy you’re studying,
how the body and mind tick. Understand not only your ruling reason—the
watchmen—but whoever and whatever rules that too.

### 27th MARCH => PAY WHAT THINGS ARE WORTH

- The good things in life cost what they cost. The
unnecessary things are not worth it at any price.

### 28th MARCH => COWARDICE AS A DESIGN PROBLEM

- Don’t try to make it up on the fly. Have a plan.

### 29th MARCH => WHY DO YOU NEED TO IMPRESS THESE PEOPLE AGAIN?

- Suddenly we’re wearing uncomfortable, ridiculous clothes we’ve
been told are cool, eating differently, talking differently, eagerly waiting for
a call or text. 
- If we did these things because we liked it, that would be one
thing. But that’s not what it is. It’s just a means to an end—to get someone
to give us the nod.

- “We buy things we don’t need, to impress people we don’t like.”

### 30th MARCH => REASON IN ALL THINGS

- As we examine our past behavior,
it’s sad how often we find this to be the case—that we were not acting
consciously or deliberately but instead by forces we did not bother to
evaluate. 
- It also happens that these are the instances that we’re mostly likely
to regret.

### 31st MARCH => YOU’RE A PRODUCT OF YOUR TRAINING

- A mind that isn’t in control of itself, that
doesn’t understand its power to regulate itself, will be jerked around by
external events and unquestioned impulses.
