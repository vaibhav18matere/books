# Daily Stoic

## THE DECEPLINE OF ACTION -

## Right Action -

### 1st MAY - MAKE CHARACTER YOUR LOUDEST STATEMENT

- For philosophy doesn’t consist in outward display, but paying attention to something what is needed and being mindful of it.

### 2nd MAY - BE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE

- Our perceptions & principles guide us in the selection of what we want, but ultimately our actions determine whether we get there or not.

### 3rd MAY - SHOW, NOT TELL, WHAT YOU KNOW

- “Those who receive the bare theories immediately want to spew them, as an upset stomach does its food. First digest your theories and you won’t throw them up. Otherwise they will be raw, spoiled, and not nourishing. After you’ve digested them, show us the changes in your reasoned choices, just like the shoulders of
gymnasts display their diet and training,nd as the craft of artisans show in what they’ve learned.”
- The goal is to turn these words into works.
- When you catch yourself wanting to condescendingly drop some knowledge that you have, grab it and ask: "Would I be better saying words or letting my actions and choices illustrate that knowledge for me?"

### 4th MAY - WHAT’S TRULY IMPRESSIVE

### 5th MAY - YOU ARE THE PROJECT

- Your mind is the asset that must be worked on most—and understood best.

### 6th MAY - RIGHTEOUSNESS IS BEAUTIFUL

### 7th MAY - HOW TO HAVE A GOOD DAY

- Here is how to guarantee you have a good day: "do good things".
- Any other source of joy is outside your control or is non-renewable.

### 8th MAY - GOOD AND EVIL? LOOK AT YOUR CHOICES

- “Where is Good? In our reasoned choices. Where is Evil? In our reasoned choices. 
- Where is that which is neither Good nor Evil? In the things outside of our own reasoned choice.”
- Ignore everything else. Focus only on your choices ; have clarity and confidence.

## 9th May - CARPE DIEM

- When someone asks you what you did yesterday, do you really want the answer to be “nothing”?

## 10th May - DON’T BE INSPIRED, BE INSPIRATIONAL

## 11th May - GUILT IS WORSE THAN JAIL

## 12th May - KINDNESS IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT RESPONSE

- Most rudeness, meanness, and cruelty are a mask for deep-seated
weakness.

## 13th May - FUELING THE HABIT BONFIRE

- Think about your activities of the last week as well as what you have
planned for today and the week that follows. 

- The person you’d like to be, or the person you see yourself as - 
how closely do  your actions actually correspond to him or her? 

- Which fire are you fueling? Which person are you becoming?

## 14th May - OUR WELL-BEING LIES IN OUR ACTIONS

- If your happiness is dependent on accomplishing certain goals, what happens if fate intervenes? What if you’re snubbed? If outside events interrupt? What if you do achieve everything but find that nobody is impressed? That’s the problem with letting your happiness be determined by things you can’t control. It’s an insane risk.
- Our ambition should not be to win, then, but to play with our full effort. Our intention is not to be thanked or recognized, but to help and to do what
we think is right. Our focus is not on what happens to us but on how we respond. In this, we will always find contentment and resilience.

## 15th May - COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS

- Today, stop trying to get what other people have. Appreciate and take advantage of what you already do have, and let that attitude guide your actions

## 16th May - THE CHAIN METHOD

- Success becomes a matter of momentum. Once you get a little, it’s easier to keep it going.
- Start with one day doing whatever it is, be it managing your temper or wandering eyes or procrastination. 
- Then do the same the following day and the day after that.
- Build a chain and then work not to break it. 
- Don’t ruin your streak.

## 17th May - THE STOIC IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

- Instead of seeing philosophy as an end to which one aspires, see it as something one applies.
