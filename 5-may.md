## THE DECEPLINE OF ACTION -

## Right Action -

### 1st MAY - MAKE CHARACTER YOUR LOUDEST STATEMENT

- For philosophy doesnâ€™t consist in outward display, but paying attention to something what is needed and being mindful of it.

### 2nd MAY - BE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE

- Our perceptions & principles guide us in the selection of what we want, but ultimately our actions determine whether we get there or not.
