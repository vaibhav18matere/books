# Daily Stoic

## THE DECEPLINE OF ACTION -

## Right Action -

### 1st MAY - MAKE CHARACTER YOUR LOUDEST STATEMENT

- For philosophy doesn’t consist in outward display, but paying attention to something what is needed and being mindful of it.

### 2nd MAY - BE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE

- Our perceptions & principles guide us in the selection of what we want, but ultimately our actions determine whether we get there or not.

### 3rd MAY - SHOW, NOT TELL, WHAT YOU KNOW

- “Those who receive the bare theories immediately want to spew them, as an upset stomach does its food. First digest your theories and you won’t throw them up. Otherwise they will be raw, spoiled, and not nourishing. After you’ve digested them, show us the changes in your reasoned choices, just like the shoulders of
gymnasts display their diet and training,nd as the craft of artisans show in what they’ve learned.”
- The goal is to turn these words into works.
- When you catch yourself wanting to condescendingly drop some knowledge that you have, grab it and ask: "Would I be better saying words or letting my actions and choices illustrate that knowledge for me?"

### 4th MAY - WHAT’S TRULY IMPRESSIVE

### 5th MAY - YOU ARE THE PROJECT

- Your mind is the asset that must be worked on most—and understood best.

### 6th MAY - RIGHTEOUSNESS IS BEAUTIFUL

### 7th MAY - HOW TO HAVE A GOOD DAY

- Here is how to guarantee you have a good day: "do good things".
- Any other source of joy is outside your control or is non-renewable.

### 8th MAY - GOOD AND EVIL? LOOK AT YOUR CHOICES

- “Where is Good? In our reasoned choices. Where is Evil? In our reasoned choices. 
- Where is that which is neither Good nor Evil? In the things outside of our own reasoned choice.”
- Ignore everything else. Focus only on your choices ; have clarity and confidence.
