**INTRODUCTION**

> THE MISCONCEPTION: You are a rational, logical being who sees the world
as it really is.
> 

> THE TRUTH: You are as deluded as the rest of us, but that's OK, it keeps you
sane.
> 
- You have no clue why you act the way you do, choose the things you choose, or think the
thoughts you think. Instead, you create narratives, little stories to explain why you did, what toy
did.
1. Confirmation Biased - You tend to look for information that confirms your beliefs and ignore
information that challenges them. This is called confirmation bias. The contents of your
bookshelf and the bookmarks in your web browser are a direct result of it.
• Ex. Wason Selection Task

2. Heuristics - Mental shortcuts you use to solve common problems. They speed up processing in
the brain, but sometimes make you think so fast you miss what is important.
• Ex. If you notice a rise in reports about shark attacks on the news, you start to believe
sharks are out of control, when the only thing you know for sure is the news is delivering
more stories about sharks than usual.

3. Logical fallacies - They are arguments in your mind where you reach a conclusion without all
the facts because you don't care to hear them or have no idea how limited your information is.
• If you hear Albert Einstein refused to eat scrambled eggs, you might assume scrambled
eggs are probably bad for you. This is called "the argument from authority". You assume if
someone is super-smart, then all of that person's decisions must be good ones, but maybe
Einstein just had peculiar taste.

**PRIMING**

> THE MISCONCEPTION : You know when you are being influenced and how it
is affecting your behavior.
> 

> THE TRUTH: You are unaware of the constant nudging you receive from
ideas formed in your unconscious mind.

💡 When a stimulus in the past affects the way you behave and think or the way you perceive another stimulus later on, it is called “priming”.

</aside>

1. Every perception, no matter if you consciously notice, sets off a chain of related ideas in your neural network. 
    - Pencils make you think of pens.
    - Blackboards make you think of classrooms.
2. It happens to you all the time, and though you are unaware, it changes the way you behave.

3. You construct reality from minute to minute with memories and emotions orbiting your
sensations and cognition; together they form a collage of consciousness that exists only in your skull.

4. Priming works best when you are on autopilot, when you aren’t trying to consciously introspect before choosing how to behave. When you are unsure how best to proceed, suggestions bubble up from the deep that are highly tainted by subconscious primes. 

5. In addition, your brain hates ambiguity and is willing to take shortcuts to remove it from any situation. If there is nothing else to go on, you will use what is available.
    - When pattern recognition fails, you create patterns of your own.
6. You often invent narratives to explain your feelings and decisions and musings
because you aren’t aware of the advice you’ve been given by the mind behind the curtain in your head.

7. When you engage in deep introspection over the causes of your own behavior
you miss many, perhaps most, of the influences accumulating on your persona.

**CONFABULATION**

> THE MISCONCEPTION:  You know when you are lying to yourself.
> 

> THE TRUTH: You are often ignorant of your motivations and create fictional
narratives to explain your decisions, emotions, and history without realizing it.

💡 You are a story you tell to yourself.

</aside>

1. You engage in introspection, and with great confidence you see the history of your life with all the characters and settings and you at the center as protagonist (hero) in the tale of who you are.  
2. This is all a great, beautiful confabulation (it’s a **disorder wherein patient generates a false memory without the intention of cheating**) 
~ and without which you could not function.
3. How do you separate fantasy from reality? How can you be sure the story of your life both from long ago and minute to minute is true? There is a pleasant vindication to be found when you accept that you can’t.
- No one can, yet we persist and thrive. Who you think you are is sort of like a movie based on true events, which is not necessarily a bad thing.
- The details may be embellished, but the big picture, the general idea, is probably a good story worth hearing about.
