1. Habits are the compound interest of self improvement.

2. You get what you repeat -

   - Your outcomes are lagging measure of your habits.
   - Your net-worth is lagging measure of your financial habits.
   - Your knowledge is lagging measure of your learning habits.
   - Your clutter is lagging measure of your cleaning habits!

3. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions which build up the potential required to unleash major change.

4. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem.

   - What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.

5. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

   - ex. If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, & run marketing campaigns.

   - Forget about goals, focus on systems instead.

6. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.

   - The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed.

   - You need to be patient.

7. If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours.

   - If you’re continuously feeling like you’re not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy. (PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS)

8. ENVIRONMENT :

   - Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one.

   - The mantra is “One space, one use”.

   - It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.

   - Focus comes automatically when you are sitting at your work desk.

   - Relaxation is easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose.

   - Sleep comes quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom.

   - If you want "behaviors" that are stable and predictable, you need an "environment" that is stable and predictable.

9. "In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed." As a result, one of the deepest human desires is - to belong.

   - and this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.

   - One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.

   - ex. Bootcamps, communities, clubs, groups, teams, organisation etc.

   - Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one.

10. Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires.

    - Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not.

11. The implementation intention formula is: I will do this] at [this timw] in (hall/bedroom/office/kitchen).

12. The habit stacking formula is: After [doing this], I will [do this].

13. Our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves.

14. How long does it actually take to form habit ?

    - “Neurons that fire together wire together.” said by Donald Hebb.

    - “Repetition is a form of change.” said by George H. Lewes.

    - Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit.

15. "Most effective form of learning is practicing and not planning."

    - Create environment where doing right things will be more easy for you, make it more accessible and you will eventually do it.

16. Make gateway hobby - Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit should be 'to put on your running shoes'.

    - Then Increase the level of difficulty!

17. Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard.

    - The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do.

18. The problem isn’t knowledge. The problem is consistency.

    - What is rewarded is repeated, What is punished is avoided.

    - “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa...

    - 'Instance Gratification'.

19. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. "Short term pleasure = long term pain"

    - With good habits, it is the reverse:

20. Habit tracking :

    - creates a visual cue that can remind you to act.

    - is motivating because you see the progress you are making.

    - feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit.
