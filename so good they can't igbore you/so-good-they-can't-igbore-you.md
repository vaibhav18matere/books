-  "Why skills trump passion in the quest of work you love."

- The narratives in this book are bound by a common thread: the importance of ability.

- Author says- “Follow your passion is dangerous advice”.

- Move your focus away from finding the "right work" & "working right".

- It provides you with a realistic path toward a meaningful & engaging working life instead of simplistic phrases like “follow your passion” & “do what you love”.

- You need to be good at something before you can expect a good job.

- "The Passion Hypothesis" : 

- Most of books, self proclaimed gurus, bloggers, professional counselors gives this advice to follow your passion. 

- But when you look past the feel-good slogans and go deeper into the details, it won't work in real life.

- People quote Steve Jobs speech at Stanford. But we need to "Do What Steve Jobs Did, Not What He Said".

- "Passion Is Rare" :

- Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow
your passion.

- "Passion Takes Time".

- Happiest, most passionate employees are not those who followed their passion into a position, 
but instead those who have been around long enough to become good at what they do.

- If you have many years’ experience, then you’ve had time to get better at what you do 
& develop a feeling of efficacy. 

- It also gives you time to develop strong relationships with your coworkers & to see many examples 
of your work benefiting others.

- "The craftsman mindset" - a focus on what value you’re 
producing in your job, and the "passion mindset" - a focus on what value your job offers you.

- "I am suggesting that you put aside the question of whether your job is your true passion, and instead turn
your focus toward becoming so good they can’t ignore you. 

- That is, regardless of what you do for a living, approach your work like a true performer".

- regardless of how you feel about your job right now,
adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you’ll build a compelling career.

- What makes a great job great ?
-  Creativity, Impact & Control.

- I feel this book is loosing it's track in between. I've read almost 25% & I don't think I can continue
reading. 

- The job of author is to hold readers, he failed it many times while defending his earlier statements. 

- So I am not reading from here onwards. Will pick another one.
