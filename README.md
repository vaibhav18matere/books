# Daily Stoic
## Clearity
- 1st Jan =>
- The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating
between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have
influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather
no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No
amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different
country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you.
And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects
is time not spent on the things we can change

Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
