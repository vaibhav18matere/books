# Daily Stoic
## Clearity

- 1. CONTROL AND CHOICE
- The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating
  between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have
  influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather
  no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No
  amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different
  country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you.
  And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects
  is time not spent on the things we can change

- Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
  courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
- If we can focus on making clear what
  parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not
  only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who
  fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.
