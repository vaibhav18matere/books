# Daily Stoic

## Clearity 

### 1st JAN. => CONTROL AND CHOICE
- The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating
  between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have
  influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather
  no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No
  amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different
  country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you.
  And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects
  is time not spent on the things we can change

- Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
  courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
- If we can focus on making clear what
  parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not
  only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who
  fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.
  
 ### 2nd JAN. => EDUCATION IS FREEDOM
 - Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not
   to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose.
   
 ### 3rd JAN. => BE RUTHLESS TO THE THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER
 - “How many have laid waste to your life when you weren’t aware of
  what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief,
  foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements—how little of
  your own was left to you. You will realize you are dying before
  your time!”
  
  - One of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to
  requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even
  harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement,
  distraction, obsession, lust ETC
  
  - the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the
  things that do. It may take some hard work but this will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that you want.
  
  ### 4th JAN. => THE BIG THREE
  - Control your perceptions. 
  - Direct your actions properly.
  - Willingly accept what’s outside your control.
    That’s all we need to do.
      
  ### 5th JAN. => CLARIFY YOUR INTENTIONS
  - It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of
    things that drive them mad.
  - The second habit in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is: begin with an
    end in mind
  - Law 29 of The 48 Laws of Power is: Plan All The Way To The End.
  - Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it, but not having an end in mind is a
    guarantee you won’t.
    
  ### 6th JAN. => WHERE, WHO, WHAT, AND WHY
  
  - Have you taken the time to get clarity about who you are and what you stand for? 
  - Or are you too busy chasing  unimportant things, mimicking the wrong influences, 
  and following disappointing or unfulfilling or nonexistent paths?
  
   ### 7th JAN. => SEVEN CLEAR FUNCTIONS OF THE MIND

 - Choice — to do and think right
 - Refusal — of temptation
 - Yearning — to be better
 - Repulsion — of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true
 - Preparation — for what lies ahead or whatever may happen
 - Purpose — our guiding principle and highest priority
 - Assent — to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside our control (and be ready to accept the latter)
 
  ### 8th JAN => SEEING OUR ADDICTIONS

- What we consider to be harmless indulgences can easily become fullblown addictions. ex. checking phone regularly, having coffee everyday etc.
- We must give up many things to which we are addicted.
- addiction is when we’ve “lost the freedom to abstain.” 
- Let us reclaim that freedom.
  
 ### 9th JAN => WHAT WE CONTROL AND WHAT WE DON’T
  
- “Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control
  our opinion, choice, desire, aversion. We don’t control our body, property, reputation,
  position.
  
- You don’t control the situation, but you control what
  you think about it. 
   
 ### 10th JAN => IF YOU WANT TO BE STEADY
 
- The Stoics seek steadiness, stability, and tranquility (calmness)
- it’s about filtering the outside world through the straightener of our judgment.

### 11th JAN => IF YOU WANT TO BE UNSTEADY

- Serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment.

### 12th JAN => THE ONE PATH TO SERENITY

- Remind yourself of what is in your control and what’s not in your control. 
- Remind yourself to focus on the former and not the latter.

### 13th JAN => CIRCLE OF CONTROL

- According to the Stoics, the circle of control contains just one
thing: YOUR MIND

### 14th JAN => CUT THE STRINGS THAT PULL YOUR MIND

- Food scientists are engineering products to exploit
your taste buds. Silicon Valley engineers are designing applications as
addictive as gambling. The media is manufacturing stories to provoke
outrage and anger.

- Every human being is pulled by these ( gossip, fear, suspicion, lust ..)
internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder
to resist.

- “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.” - Viktor Frankl (The Will to Meaning)

### 15th JAN => PEACE IS IN STAYING THE COURSE

- We don’t need to constantly compare ourselves
with other people or change our mind every three seconds based on new
information.

- Tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in
sticking to it: staying the course — making adjustments here and there, 
naturally—but ignoring the distracting sirens.

### 18th JAN => SEE THE WORLD LIKE A POET AND AN ARTIST

  the principles themselves remain unchanged. 
- We can return and embrace them at any moment. 
  What happened yesterday — what happened five minutes ago — is the past. 
  We can reignite and restart whenever we like.
  ...Why not do it right now?

### 21st JAN => A MORNING RITUAL

- Many successful people have a morning ritual. meditation, exercise, journaling—just a
  few pages where they write down their thoughts, fears, hopes. In these
  cases, the point is not so much the activity itself as it is the ritualized
  reflection. The idea is to take some time to look inward and examine.

### 22nd JAN => THE DAY IN REVIEW

- Keep your own journal, whether it’s saved on a computer or in a little
  notebook. Take time to consciously recall the events of the previous day. 
- Notice what contributed to your happiness
  and what detracted from it. 
- Write down what you’d like to work on or
  quotes that you like. By making the effort to record such thoughts, you’re
  less likely to forget them. 
- An added bonus: you’ll have a running tally to
  track your progress too.

### 23rd JAN => THE TRUTH ABOUT MONEY

  affection, freedom, and justice—giving yourself a break from all

  if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion
  of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair
  share.

- You can see how mastery over a few things makes it
  possible to live an abundant and devout life—for, if you keep
  watch over these things, the gods won’t ask for more.

### 1st FEB => FOR THE HOT-HEADED MAN

   their passions—rather than "controlled by" their passions.
   
 ### 2nd FEB => A PROPER FRAME OF MIND
 
 - We would never let another person jerk us around the way we let our
  impulses do. It’s time we start seeing it that way — that we’re not puppets

### 13th FEB -> PLEASURE CAN BECOME PUNISHMENT

- “Whenever you get an impression of some pleasure, as with any
impression, guard yourself from being carried away by it, let it
await your action, give yourself a pause. 
- After that, bring to mind
both times, first when you have enjoyed the pleasure and later
when you will regret it and hate yourself. 
- Then compare to those the joy and satisfaction you’d feel for abstaining altogether.
- However, if a seemingly appropriate time arises to act on it, don’t
be overcome by its comfort, pleasantness, and allure—but against
all of this, how much better the consciousness of conquering it.”
—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION.

pleasurable as these activities might seem, they ruin your chance at
happiness here and now.

Am I in control of them or they in control of me?
 
 ### 22nd FEB => WHAT’S BETTER LEFT UNSAID
 
 - It’s easy to act—to just dive in. It’s harder to stop, to pause, to think: No,
I’m not sure I need to do that yet. I’m not sure I am ready.

PASSION

### 28th FEB => WHEN YOU LOSE CONTROL

- “The soul is like a bowl of water, and our impressions are like the
ray of light falling upon the water. When the water is troubled, it
appears that the light itself is moved too, but it isn’t. So, when a
person loses their composure it isn’t their skills and virtues that
are troubled, but the spirit in which they exist, and when that spirit
calms down so do those things.”

### 29th FEB => YOU CAN’T ALWAYS (BE) GET(TING) WHAT YOU WANT

- “Don’t set your heart on so many things.” 
-  Focus. Prioritize. 
-  Train your mind to ask: Do I need this thing? What will happen if I do not get it? Can I make do without it?
- The answers to these questions will help you relax, help you cut out all the needless things that make you busy—too busy to be balanced or happy.

## Awareness
### 1st MARCH => WHERE PHILOSOPHY BEGINS

- we begin our journey into

- “Above all, it is necessary for a person to have a true self-estimate, for we commonly think we can do more than we really can.”
