# Daily Stoic

## Clearity 
### 1st JAN.   CONTROL AND CHOICE
- The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating
  between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have
  influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather
  no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No
  amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different
  country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you.
  And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects
  is time not spent on the things we can change

- Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
  courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
- If we can focus on making clear what
  parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not
  only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who
  fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.
  
 ### 2nd JAN. EDUCATION IS FREEDOM
 - Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not
   to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose.
   
 ### 3rd JAN.   BE RUTHLESS TO THE THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER
 - “How many have laid waste to your life when you weren’t aware of
  what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief,
  foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements—how little of
  your own was left to you. You will realize you are dying before
  your time!”
  
  - One of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to
  requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even
  harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement,
  distraction, obsession, lust ETC
  
  - the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the
  things that do. It may take some hard work but this will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that you want.
  
  ### 4th JAN.   THE BIG THREE
  - Control your perceptions. 
  - Direct your actions properly.
  - Willingly accept what’s outside your control.
    That’s all we need to do.
      
  ### 5th JAN.   CLARIFY YOUR INTENTIONS
  - It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of
    things that drive them mad.
  - The second habit in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is: begin with an
    end in mind
  - Law 29 of The 48 Laws of Power is: Plan All The Way To The End.
  - Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it, but not having an end in mind is a
    guarantee you won’t.
