# Daily Stoic

## Clearity 

### 1st JAN. => CONTROL AND CHOICE
- The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating
  between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have
  influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather
  no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No
  amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different
  country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you.
  And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects
  is time not spent on the things we can change

- Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
  courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
- If we can focus on making clear what
  parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not
  only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who
  fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.
  
 ### 2nd JAN. => EDUCATION IS FREEDOM
 - Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not
   to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose.
   
 ### 3rd JAN. => BE RUTHLESS TO THE THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER
 - “How many have laid waste to your life when you weren’t aware of
  what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief,
  foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements—how little of
  your own was left to you. You will realize you are dying before
  your time!”
  
  - One of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to
  requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even
  harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement,
  distraction, obsession, lust ETC
  
  - the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the
  things that do. It may take some hard work but this will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that you want.
  
  ### 4th JAN. => THE BIG THREE
  - Control your perceptions. 
  - Direct your actions properly.
  - Willingly accept what’s outside your control.
    That’s all we need to do.
      
  ### 5th JAN. => CLARIFY YOUR INTENTIONS
  - It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of
    things that drive them mad.
  - The second habit in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is: begin with an
    end in mind
  - Law 29 of The 48 Laws of Power is: Plan All The Way To The End.
  - Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it, but not having an end in mind is a
    guarantee you won’t.
    
  ### 6th JAN. => WHERE, WHO, WHAT, AND WHY
  
  - Have you taken the time to get clarity about who you are and what you stand for? 
  - Or are you too busy chasing  unimportant things, mimicking the wrong influences, 
  and following disappointing or unfulfilling or nonexistent paths?
  
   ### 7th JAN. => SEVEN CLEAR FUNCTIONS OF THE MIND

 - Choice — to do and think right
 - Refusal — of temptation
 - Yearning — to be better
 - Repulsion — of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true
 - Preparation — for what lies ahead or whatever may happen
 - Purpose — our guiding principle and highest priority
 - Assent — to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside our control (and be ready to accept the latter)
 
  ### 8th JAN => SEEING OUR ADDICTIONS

- What we consider to be harmless indulgences can easily become fullblown addictions. ex. checking phone regularly, having coffee everyday etc.
- We must give up many things to which we are addicted.
- addiction is when we’ve “lost the freedom to abstain.” 
- Let us reclaim that freedom.
  
 ### 9th JAN => WHAT WE CONTROL AND WHAT WE DON’T
  
- “Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control
  our opinion, choice, desire, aversion. We don’t control our body, property, reputation,
  position.
  
- You don’t control the situation, but you control what
  you think about it. 
   
 ### 10th JAN => IF YOU WANT TO BE STEADY
 
- The Stoics seek steadiness, stability, and tranquility (calmness)
- it’s about filtering the outside world through the straightener of our judgment.

### 11th JAN => IF YOU WANT TO BE UNSTEADY

- Serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment.

### 12th JAN => THE ONE PATH TO SERENITY

- Remind yourself of what is in your control and what’s not in your control. 
- Remind yourself to focus on the former and not the latter.

### 13th JAN => CIRCLE OF CONTROL

- According to the Stoics, the circle of control contains just one
thing: YOUR MIND

### 14th JAN => CUT THE STRINGS THAT PULL YOUR MIND

- Food scientists are engineering products to exploit
your taste buds. Silicon Valley engineers are designing applications as
addictive as gambling. The media is manufacturing stories to provoke
outrage and anger.

- Every human being is pulled by these ( gossip, fear, suspicion, lust ..)
internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder
to resist.

- “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.” - Viktor Frankl (The Will to Meaning)

### 15th JAN => PEACE IS IN STAYING THE COURSE

- We don’t need to constantly compare ourselves
with other people or change our mind every three seconds based on new
information.

- Tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in
sticking to it: staying the course — making adjustments here and there, 
naturally—but ignoring the distracting sirens.


### 16th January => NEVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF HABIT

- The person in training must seek to rise above
- Ask yourself: Is this really the best way to do it? Keep improve

### 17th JAN => REBOOT THE REAL WORK

- just begin the work. The rest follows

### 18th JAN => SEE THE WORLD LIKE A POET AND AN ARTIST

- There is clarity (and joy) in seeing what others can’t see, in finding
grace and harmony in places others overlook. Isn’t that far better than
seeing the world as some dark place?

### 19th JANUARY => WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE YOUR CHOICE IS

- One thing will stay constant: our freedom of choice—both in the big picture and small picture.

### 20th JAN => REIGNITE YOUR THOUGHTS

- No matter what happens, no matter how disappointing our behavior has been in the past, 
  the principles themselves remain unchanged. 
- We can return and embrace them at any moment. 
  What happened yesterday — what happened five minutes ago — is the past. 
  We can reignite and restart whenever we like.
  ...Why not do it right now?

### 21st JAN => A MORNING RITUAL

- Many successful people have a morning ritual. meditation, exercise, journaling—just a
  few pages where they write down their thoughts, fears, hopes. In these
  cases, the point is not so much the activity itself as it is the ritualized
  reflection. The idea is to take some time to look inward and examine.

### 22nd JAN => THE DAY IN REVIEW

- Keep your own journal, whether it’s saved on a computer or in a little
  notebook. Take time to consciously recall the events of the previous day. 
- Notice what contributed to your happiness
  and what detracted from it. 
- Write down what you’d like to work on or
  quotes that you like. By making the effort to record such thoughts, you’re
  less likely to forget them. 
- An added bonus: you’ll have a running tally to
  track your progress too.

### 23rd JAN => THE TRUTH ABOUT MONEY

### 24th JAN => PUSH FOR DEEP UNDERSTANDING

- "I learned to read carefully and not be satisfied
  with a rough understanding of the whole, and not to agree too
  quickly with those who have a lot to say about something."

### 25th JAN => THE ONLY PRIZE

- The more things we desire and the more we have to do to earn or attain
  those achievements, the less we actually enjoy our lives—and the less free
  we are.

### 26th JAN => THE POWER OF A MANTRA

- Mantra = “sacred utterance” allows us to block out everything else while we focus.
- have a mantra and use it to find the clarity you crave.

### 27th JAN => THE THREE AREAS OF TRAINING

- (a) desires & aversions (2) impulses to act & not to act (3) freedom from deception & composure

### 28th JAN => WATCHING THE WISE

- Who that person will be for you is up to you? 
- Pick someone, watch what they do (and what they don’t do), and do
  your best to do the same.

### 29th JAN => KEEP IT SIMPLE

- At every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand.

- Doing it with strict and simple dignity,
  affection, freedom, and justice—giving yourself a break from all
  other considerations.

- You can do this if you approach each task as
  if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion
  of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair
  share.

- You can see how mastery over a few things makes it
  possible to live an abundant and devout life—for, if you keep
  watch over these things, the gods won’t ask for more.

- We don’t need to get lost in a thousand other distractions or in other people’s business.

- Find clarity in the simplicity of doing your job today

### 30th JAN => YOU DON’T HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF EVERYTHING

- If you wish to improve, be content to appear clueless or stupid in
  irrelevant matters/situations/topics.

### 31st JAN => PHILOSOPHY AS MEDICINE OF THE SOUL

- Stoicism is designed to be medicine for the soul. 
- It relieves us of the vulnerabilities of modern life. It restores us with the vigor we need to thrive
  in life. Check in with it today, and let it do its healing.

## Passions and emotions

### 1st FEB => FOR THE HOT-HEADED MAN

- Strength is the ability to maintain a hold of oneself. 
- Strength is being the person who never gets mad, who cannot be rattled, 
   because they are in control of
   their passions—rather than "controlled by" their passions.
   
 ### 2nd FEB => A PROPER FRAME OF MIND
 
 - We would never let another person jerk us around the way we let our
  impulses do. It’s time we start seeing it that way — that we’re not puppets
  that can be made to dance this way or that way just because we feel like it.
  
 - We should be the ones in control, not our emotions, because we are
  independent, self-sufficient people.
  
### 3rd FEB => THE SOURCE OF YOUR ANXIETY

- when you find yourself getting anxious, ask yourself: Is my anxiety doing me any good ?

### 4th FEB => ON BEING INVINCIBLE

- “Invincible is the one who cannot be upset by anything
outside their reasoned choice”

### 5th FEB => STEADY YOUR IMPULSES

- Think before you act

### 6th FEB => DON’T SEEK OUT STRIFE

- We’re afraid of being still, so we seek out strife and action as a
distraction.

### 7th FEB => FEAR IS A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY

Prophecy - a prediction of what will happen in the future)

- The combination of power, fear, and mania can be deadly.

### 8th FEB => DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

- The next time someone gets upset near you—crying, yelling, breaking
something, being pointed or cruel—watch how quickly this statement
will stop them cold: “I hope this is making you feel better.”

### 9th FEB => YOU DON’T HAVE TO HAVE AN OPINION

- “We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing and to not let
it upset our state of mind—for things have no natural power to
shape our judgments.”

- It is possible to hold no opinion about a negative thing.

### 10th FEB => ANGER IS BAD FUEL

### 11th FEB => HERO OR NERO?

### 12th FEB => PROTECT YOUR PEACE OF MIND

- Don’t be afraid to make a change—a big one

### 13th FEB -> PLEASURE CAN BECOME PUNISHMENT

- “Whenever you get an impression of some pleasure, as with any
impression, guard yourself from being carried away by it, let it
await your action, give yourself a pause. 
- After that, bring to mind
both times, first when you have enjoyed the pleasure and later
when you will regret it and hate yourself. 
- Then compare to those the joy and satisfaction you’d feel for abstaining altogether.
- However, if a seemingly appropriate time arises to act on it, don’t
be overcome by its comfort, pleasantness, and allure—but against
all of this, how much better the consciousness of conquering it.”
—EPICTETUS, ENCHIRIDION.

### 14th FEB => THINK BEFORE YOU ACT

### 15th FEB => THE THING THAT PROVOKED YOU WASN'T REAL - BUT YOUR REACTION WAS.

### 16th FEB => DON’T MAKE THINGS HARDER THAN THEY NEED TO BE

### 17th FEB => THE ENEMY OF HAPPINESS

- Eagerly anticipating some future event, passionately imagining
something you desire, looking forward to some happy scenario - ... as
pleasurable as these activities might seem, they ruin your chance at
happiness here and now.

- Those are conditional happiness !

### 18th FEB => PREPARE FOR THE STORM

- If we don’t have a plan, if we never learned how to put up the storm
windows, we will be at the mercy of external—and internal—
elements.

### 19th FEB => THE BANQUET OF LIFE
### 20th FEB => THE GRAND PARADE OF DESIRE

### 21th FEB => WISH NOT, WANT NOT

- When it comes to your goals and the things you strive for, ask yourself:
Am I in control of them or they in control of me?
 
 ### 22nd FEB => WHAT’S BETTER LEFT UNSAID
 
 - It’s easy to act—to just dive in. It’s harder to stop, to pause, to think: No,
I’m not sure I need to do that yet. I’m not sure I am ready.

### 23rd FEB => CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE NO CARE FOR OUR FEELINGS

- “You shouldn’t give circumstances the power to rouse anger, for
they don’t care at all.”

### 24th FEB => THE REAL SOURCE OF HARM

- If that same event happened to us at
different points in our lifetime, we might have very different reactions.

### 25th FEB => THE SMOKE AND DUST OF MYTH

### 26th FEB => TO EACH HIS OWN

- “Another has done me wrong? Let him see to it. He has his own
tendencies, and his own affairs. What I have now is what the
common nature has willed, and what I endeavor to accomplish
now is what my nature wills.”

### 27th FEB => CULTIVATING INDIFFERENCE WHERE OTHERS GROW
PASSION

### 28th FEB => WHEN YOU LOSE CONTROL

- “The soul is like a bowl of water, and our impressions are like the
ray of light falling upon the water. When the water is troubled, it
appears that the light itself is moved too, but it isn’t. So, when a
person loses their composure it isn’t their skills and virtues that
are troubled, but the spirit in which they exist, and when that spirit
calms down so do those things.”

### 29th FEB => YOU CAN’T ALWAYS (BE) GET(TING) WHAT YOU WANT

- we can have it all” is the mantra of our modern lives. Work, family, purpose, success, leisure time—
we want all of this, at the same time (right now, to boot).
- “Don’t set your heart on so many things.” 
-  Focus. Prioritize. 
-  Train your mind to ask: Do I need this thing? What will happen if I do not get it
Can I make do without it?
- The answers to these questions will help you relax, help you cut out all the needless things 
that make you busy—too busy to be balanced or happy.

## Awareness
### 1st MARCH => WHERE PHILOSOPHY BEGINS

- we begin our journey into
philosophy when we become aware of the ability to analyze our own minds.

### 2nd MARCH => ACCURATE SELF-ASSESSMENT
- “Above all, it is necessary for a person to have a true self-estimate, for we commonly think 
we can do more than we really can.”
- it is a great failing “to see yourself as more than you are
- it is equally damaging to “value yourself at less than your true worth.”

### 3rd MARCH => (DIS)INTEGRATION

- We’re all complicated people. We have multiple sides to ourselves— conflicting wants, desires, and fears. 
- The outside world is no less confusing and contradictory. If we’re not careful, 
all these forces—pushing and pulling—will eventually tear us apart.
- If we do not focus on our internal integration—on self-awareness—werisk external disintegration.

### 4th MARCH => AWARENESS IS FREEDOM

- Often powerful people are slaves to their money, to their positions, to their mistresses
- We see this slavery all the time, question is "Are you as free as you think?"

### 5th MARCH => CUTTING BACK ON THE COSTLY

- “So, concerning the things we pursue, and for which we vigorously
exert ourselves, we owe this consideration—either there is nothing
useful in them, or most aren’t useful. Some of them are
superfluous, while others aren’t worth that much. But we don’t
discern this and see them as free, when they cost us dearly.”

- Even what we get for free has a cost, if only in what we pay
to store it—in our garages and in our minds. 

- As you walk past your
possessions today, ask yourself: Do I need this? Is it superfluous? What’s
this actually worth? What is it costing me?

- You might be surprised by the answers and how much we’ve been
paying without even knowing it.

### 6th MARCH => DON’T TELL YOURSELF STORIES

- “In public avoid talking often and excessively about your
accomplishments and dangers, for however much you enjoy
recounting your dangers, it’s not so pleasant for others to hear
about your affairs.”

- “Narrative Fallacy” — The tendency to assemble unrelated events of the past into stories.
- Try your best not to create this fantasy bubble—live in what’s real.
- Listen and connect with people, don’t perform for them.

### 7th MARCH => DON’T TRUST THE SENSES

- Because our senses are often wrong, our emotions overly alarmed, our
projections overly optimistic, we’re better off not rushing into conclusions
about anything. 
- We can take a beat with everything we do and become
aware of everything that’s going on,so we can make the right decision.


### 8th MARCH => DON’T UNINTENTIONALLY HAND OVER YOUR FREEDOM

- “If a person gave away your body to some passerby, you’d be
furious. Yet you hand over your mind to anyone who comes along,
so they may abuse you, leaving it disturbed and troubled—have
you no shame in that?”


### 9th MARCH => FIND THE RIGHT SCENE

- “You are the average of the five people
you spend the most time with.”

- Ask yourself about the people you meet and spend time with: Are
they making me better? Do they encourage me to push forward and hold me
accountable? Or do they drag me down to their level? Now, with this in
mind, ask the most important question: Should I spend more or less time
with these folks?

### 10th MARCH =>  FIND YOURSELF A CATO

- Cato—a great and noble person we can allow into our minds 
 and use to guide our actions, even when they’re not physically present.
- Who can stand and witness to our behavior. 
- Someone who can quietly admonish us if we are
considering doing something lazy, dishonest, or selfish.
- And if we do it right, and live our lives in such a way, perhaps we can
serve as someone else’s Cato or indifferent spectator when they need it.

### 11th MARCH => LIVING WITHOUT RESTRICTION

- “The unrestricted person, who has in hand what they will in all
events, is free. But anyone who can be restricted, coerced, or
pushed into something against what they will is a slave.”

- “Slavery resides under marble and gold.” Too
many successful people are prisoners in jails of their own making. Is that
what you want? Is that what you’re working hard toward? Let’s hope not.

### 12th MARCH => SEEING THINGS AS THE PERSON AT FAULT DOES

- Nobody thinks they’re wrong, even when they are.

### 13th MARCH => ONE DAY IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE
“Part of the reason we fight against the things that happen is that we’re so
focused on our plan that we forget that there might be a bigger plan we
don’t know about.”

### 14th MARCH = SELF-DECEPTION IS OUR ENEMY

- “It is impossible for a person to begin to learn what
he thinks he already knows.” 

- Today, we will be unable to improve, unable to learn, unable to earn the 
respect of others if we think we’re already
perfect, a genius admired far and wide. 

- In this sense, ego and self-deception
are the enemies of the things we wish to have because we delude ourselves
into believing that we already possess them.

### 15th MARCH => THE PRESENT IS ALL WE POSSESS

- Today, notice how often you look for more.That is, wanting the past to
be more than what it was.or wanting
the future to unfold exactly as you expect (with hardly a thought as to how
that might affect other people).
- When you do this, you’re neglecting the present moment.

### 16th MARCH => THAT SACRED PART OF YOU

- The fact that you can think, the fact that you can read this book, the fact
that you are able to reason in and out of situations — all of this is what
gives you the ability to improve your circumstances and become better. 

- It’s important to appreciate this ability, because it’s a genuine ability. Not everyone is so lucky.

- Seriously, what you take for granted, others wouldn’t even think to
dream of.

- Take a little time today to remember that you’re blessed with the
capacity to use logic and reason to navigate situations and circumstances.

- This gives you unthinkable power to alter your circumstances and the
circumstances of others. 

- And remember that with power comes responsibility.

### 17th MARCH => THE BEAUTY OF CHOICE

- It’s easy to confuse the image we present to the world for who we
actually are, especially when media messaging deliberately blurs that
distinction.

- Not how things appear, but what effort, activity, and choices they are a result of.

### 18th MARCH => IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT

- We can’t blame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated 
any more than we can blame them for our jealousy. The cause is within us. 

### 19th MARCH => TIMELESS WISDOM

- “The cause of my irritation is not in this person but in me.”

- The cause of our notion that something is bad : that
comes from us, from our labels or our expectations. 
- Just as easily, we can change those labels; 
we can change our entitlement and decide to accept
and love what’s happening around us.

### 20th MARCH => READY AND AT HOME

- We’d be crazy to want to face
difficulty in life. But we’d be equally crazy to pretend that it isn’t going to
happen. 

- Which is why when it knocks on our door — as it very well may this
morning — let’s make sure we’re prepared to answer!

### 21st MARCH => THE BEST RETREAT IS IN HERE, NOT OUT THERE

- Are you looking forward to the weekend so you can have some peace and quiet? 
- Maybe, you think, after things settle down or after I get this over with. 
- But how often has that ever actually worked?

- “Wherever you go, there you are.”

### 22nd MARCH => THE SIGN OF TRUE EDUCATION

- You don’t need to step into a classroom to understand the basic, 
fundamental reality of nature and of our proper role in it. 

- Begin with awareness and reflection. Not just once,
but every single second of every single day.

### 23rd MARCH => THE STRAITJACKETED SOUL

- It’s better to look at how greed and vices might be having a similar effect in
your own life. What lapses in judgment might your vices be causing you?
What “sicknesses” might you have?

- And how can your rational mind step in and regulate them?

### 24th MARCH => THERE IS PHILOSOPHY IN EVERYTHING

- Epictetus means about the study of Philosophy. Study, yes,
but go live your life as well. It’s the only way that you’ll actually
understand whether you took any of the teachings to heart.

- Be aware of that today when you’re going to work, going on a date,
deciding whom to vote for, calling your parents in the evening, waving to
your neighbor as you walk to your door, tipping the delivery man, saying
goodnight to someone you love. All of that is philosophy. All of it is
experience that brings meaning to the words.

### 25th MARCH => WEALTH AND FREEDOM ARE FREE

- “. . . freedom isn’t secured by filling up on your heart’s desire but
by removing your desire.”

### 26th MARCH => WHAT RULES YOUR RULING REASON?

- Roman satirist Juvenal is famous for this question "Who watches the watchmen?"
- Learn what underpins this philosophy you’re studying,
how the body and mind tick. Understand not only your ruling reason—the
watchmen—but whoever and whatever rules that too.

### 27th MARCH => PAY WHAT THINGS ARE WORTH

- The good things in life cost what they cost. The
unnecessary things are not worth it at any price.

### 28th MARCH => COWARDICE AS A DESIGN PROBLEM

- Don’t try to make it up on the fly. Have a plan.

### 29th MARCH => WHY DO YOU NEED TO IMPRESS THESE PEOPLE AGAIN?

- Suddenly we’re wearing uncomfortable, ridiculous clothes we’ve
been told are cool, eating differently, talking differently, eagerly waiting for
a call or text. 
- If we did these things because we liked it, that would be one
thing. But that’s not what it is. It’s just a means to an end—to get someone
to give us the nod.

- “We buy things we don’t need, to impress people we don’t like.”

### 30th MARCH => REASON IN ALL THINGS

- As we examine our past behavior,
it’s sad how often we find this to be the case—that we were not acting
consciously or deliberately but instead by forces we did not bother to
evaluate. 
- It also happens that these are the instances that we’re mostly likely
to regret.

### 31st MARCH => YOU’RE A PRODUCT OF YOUR TRAINING

- A mind that isn’t in control of itself, that
doesn’t understand its power to regulate itself, will be jerked around by
external events and unquestioned impulses.

## Unbiased Thought

### 1st APRIL => THE COLOR OF YOUR THOUGHTS

- “Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in
thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions.”

### 2nd APRIL => BE WARY OF WHAT YOU LET IN

- We’ll inevitably be exposed to external influences at some point, no matter
how much we try to avoid them. 
- But we don't need to allow those influences to penetrate our minds. 
- We have the ability to put our guard up and decide what we actually allow in. 

- Uninvited guests might arrive at your home, but you don’t have to ask them to stay for
dinner.

### 3rd APRIL => DECEIVED AND DIVIDED

- Our internal war is usually a result of our conflicting desires.

### 4th APRIL => DON’T LET THIS GO TO YOUR HEAD

- When we experience success, we must make sure that it doesn’t change
us—that we continue to maintain our character despite the temptation not
to. Reason must lead the way no matter what good fortune comes along.

### 5th APRIL => TRUST, BUT VERIFY

- ASK QUESTIONS LIKE - Is this really so bad? What do I really know about this person? Why do I have
such strong feelings here? Is anxiety really adding much to the situation?
What’s so special about it?

### 6th APRIL => PREPARE YOURSELF FOR NEGATIVITY
- ... Maybe because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll
be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding.

### 7th APRIL => EXPECT TO CHANGE YOUR OPINIONS
- We must fight our biases and preconceptions: because they
are a liabilities.
- Remember, if there is one core teaching at the heart of this philosophy,
it’s that we’re not as smart and as wise as we’d like to think we are. 
- If we ever do want to become wise, it comes from the questioning and from
humility — not, as many would like to think, from certainty, mistrust, and arrogance.

### 8th APRIL => THE COST OF ACCEPTING COUNTERFEITS

- “the first and greatest task of the
philosopher is to test and separate appearances, and to act on nothing that is
untested.”

### 9th APRIL => TEST YOUR IMPRESSIONS

- Part of Stoicism is cultivating the awareness that allows you to step back
and analyze your own senses, question their accuracy, and proceed only
with the positive and constructive ones.
- What feels right right now doesn’t
always stand up well over time. Hold your senses suspect. Again, trust, but
always verify.

### 10th APRIL => JUDGMENTS CAUSE DISTURBANCE

- “It isn’t events themselves that disturb people, but only their
judgments about them.”

### 11th APRIL => IF YOU WANT TO LEARN, BE HUMBLE

- “Throw out your conceited (excessively proud of oneself) opinions, 
for it is impossible for a person to begin to learn what he thinks he already knows.” 
- If you want to learn, if you want to improve your life, seeking out
teachers, philosophers, and great books is a good start. But this approach
will only be effective if you’re humble and ready to let go of opinions you
already have.

### 12th APRIL => REJECT TEMPTING GIFTS

- Our attraction toward what is new and shiny can lead us into serious trouble.

### 13th APRIL => LESS IS MORE

- “Don’t act grudgingly, selfishly, without due diligence, or to be a
contrarian. Don’t overdress your thought in fine language. Don’t
be a person of too many words and too many deeds. . . . Be
cheerful, not wanting outside help or the relief others might bring.
A person needs to stand on their own, not be propped up.”

### 14th APRIL => BECOMING AN EXPERT IN WHAT MATTERS

- “Believe me, it’s better to produce the balance-sheet of your own
life than that of the grain market.”

- At the end of your time on this planet, what expertise is going to be
more valuable — your understanding of matters of living and dying, or your
knowledge of the trending things ? 
- Which will help your children more — your
insight into happiness and meaning, or that you followed breaking political
news every day for thirty years ?

### 15th APRIL => PAY YOUR TAXES

- Everything we do has a toll attached to it.
- Waiting around is a tax on traveling. Rumors and gossip are the taxes that
come from acquiring a public persona. Disagreements and occasional
frustration are taxes placed on even the happiest of relationships. Theft is a
tax on abundance and having things that other people want. Stress and
problems are tariffs that come attached to success. And on and on and on.

### 16th APRIL => OBSERVE CAUSE AND EFFECT
- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy helps patients identify destructive patterns 
in their thoughts and behavior so they can, over time, direct and influence them 
in a more positive direction.
- Become an observer of your own thoughts and the actions those thoughts provoke.
- Where do they come from? What biases do they contain? Are they constructive or 
destructive? Do they cause you to make mistakes or engage in behavior you later regret? 
- Look for patterns; find where cause meets effect

### 17th APRIL => NO HARM, NO FOUL
- something said sarcastically differs drastically from something that was pointed and mean.
- The interpretation of a remark or a word has an immense amount of
power. It’s the difference between a laugh and hurt feelings. The difference
between a fight breaking out and two people connecting.
- If being upset or hurt is something you’d like to experience less often,
then make sure your interpretations of others’ words make that possible.
Choose the right inference from someone’s actions or from external events,
and it’s a lot more likely that you’ll have the right response.

### 18th APRIL => OPINIONS ARE LIKE
- Our opinion is often shaped by dogma (religious or cultural), entitlements, expectations, 
and in some cases, ignorance.
- But what if we let these opinions go? Let’s try weeding (ekkoptein; cutting or knocking out) them
out of our lives so that things simply are. Not good or bad, not colored with opinion or judgment.

### 19th APRIL => OUR SPHERE OF IMPULSES
- Be willing to learn from anyone and everyone, regardless of their station in life.

### 20th APRIL => REAL GOOD IS SIMPLE
- For centuries, people have assumed that wealth would be a wonderful
cure-all for their unhappiness or problems. Why else would they have
worked so hard for it? 
- But when people actually acquired the money and status they craved, 
they discovered it wasn’t quite what they had hoped. 
- The same is true of so many things we covet without really thinking.

### 21st APRIL => DON’T LET YOUR ATTENTION SLIDE
- “When you let your attention slide for a bit, don’t think you will get
back a grip on it whenever you wish—instead, bear in mind that
because of today’s mistake everything that follows will be
necessarily worse... 
- Is it possible to be free from error? Not by any means, but it is possible 
to be a person always stretching to avoid error.
- Attention matters— and in an era in which our attention is being fought  for by 
every new app, website, article, book, tweet, and post, its value has only gone up.
- You’ll never complete all your tasks if you allow yourself to be
distracted with every tiny interruption. 
- Your attention is one of your most critical resources. Don’t squander it!

### 22nd APRIL => THE MARKS OF A RATIONAL PERSON
- 1. First, we must look inward.
- 2. Next, we must examine ourselves critically.
- 3. Finally, we must make our own decisions — without restraint, biases or popular notions.

### 23rd APRIL => THE MIND IS ALL YOURS
- 1. The body can be severely damage by disease or injured or disabled in a sudden
accident. It can be imprisoned or subjected to torture. 
- 2. The breath can suddenly cease because our time has come, 
- or because someone has taken it from us.
- 3. But up until the very end, our mind is ours.

### 24th APRIL => A PRODUCTIVE USE FOR CONTEMPT
