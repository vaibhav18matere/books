# Daily Stoic

## Clearity 
### 1st JAN. => CONTROL AND CHOICE
- The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating
  between what we can change and what we can’t. What we have
  influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of weather
  no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No
  amount of wishing will make you taller or shorter or born in a different
  country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make someone like you.
  And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects
  is time not spent on the things we can change

- Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the
  courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.”
- If we can focus on making clear what
  parts of our day are within our control and what parts are not, we will not
  only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other people who
  fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.
  
 ### 2nd JAN. => EDUCATION IS FREEDOM
 - Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not
   to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose.
   
 ### 3rd JAN. => BE RUTHLESS TO THE THINGS THAT DON’T MATTER
 - “How many have laid waste to your life when you weren’t aware of
  what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief,
  foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements—how little of
  your own was left to you. You will realize you are dying before
  your time!”
  
  - One of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to
  requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even
  harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement,
  distraction, obsession, lust ETC
  
  - the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the
  things that do. It may take some hard work but this will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that you want.
  
  ### 4th JAN. => THE BIG THREE
  - Control your perceptions. 
  - Direct your actions properly.
  - Willingly accept what’s outside your control.
    That’s all we need to do.
      
  ### 5th JAN. => CLARIFY YOUR INTENTIONS
  - It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of
    things that drive them mad.
  - The second habit in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People is: begin with an
    end in mind
  - Law 29 of The 48 Laws of Power is: Plan All The Way To The End.
  - Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it, but not having an end in mind is a
    guarantee you won’t.
    
  ### 6th JAN. => WHERE, WHO, WHAT, AND WHY
  
  - Have you taken the time to get clarity about who you are and what you stand for? 
  - Or are you too busy chasing  unimportant things, mimicking the wrong influences, 
  and following disappointing or unfulfilling or nonexistent paths?
  
   ### 7th JAN. => SEVEN CLEAR FUNCTIONS OF THE MIND

 - Choice — to do and think right
 - Refusal — of temptation
 - Yearning — to be better
 - Repulsion — of negativity, of bad influences, of what isn’t true
 - Preparation — for what lies ahead or whatever may happen
 - Purpose — our guiding principle and highest priority
 - Assent — to be free of deception about what’s inside and outside our control (and be ready to accept the latter)
 
  ### 8th JAN => SEEING OUR ADDICTIONS

- What we consider to be harmless indulgences can easily become fullblown addictions. ex. checking phone regularly, having coffee everyday etc.
- We must give up many things to which we are addicted.
- addiction is when we’ve “lost the freedom to abstain.” 
- Let us reclaim that freedom.
  
 ### 9th JAN => WHAT WE CONTROL AND WHAT WE DON’T
  
- “Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control
  our opinion, choice, desire, aversion. We don’t control our body, property, reputation,
  position.
  
- You don’t control the situation, but you control what
  you think about it. 
   
 ### 10th JAN => IF YOU WANT TO BE STEADY
 
- The Stoics seek steadiness, stability, and tranquility (calmness)
- it’s about filtering the outside world through the straightener of our judgment.

### 11th JAN => IF YOU WANT TO BE UNSTEADY

- Serenity and stability are results of your choices and judgment, not your environment.

### 12th JAN => THE ONE PATH TO SERENITY

- Remind yourself of what is in your control and what’s not in your control. 
- Remind yourself to focus on the former and not the latter.

### 13th JAN => CIRCLE OF CONTROL

- According to the Stoics, the circle of control contains just one
thing: YOUR MIND

### 14th JAN => CUT THE STRINGS THAT PULL YOUR MIND

- Food scientists are engineering products to exploit
your taste buds. Silicon Valley engineers are designing applications as
addictive as gambling. The media is manufacturing stories to provoke
outrage and anger.

- Every human being is pulled by these ( gossip, fear, suspicion, lust ..)
internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder
to resist.

- “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.” - Viktor Frankl (The Will to Meaning)

### 15th JAN => PEACE IS IN STAYING THE COURSE

- We don’t need to constantly compare ourselves
with other people or change our mind every three seconds based on new
information.

- Tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in
sticking to it: staying the course — making adjustments here and there, 
naturally—but ignoring the distracting sirens.


### 16th January => NEVER DO ANYTHING OUT OF HABIT

- The person in training must seek to rise above
- Ask yourself: Is this really the best way to do it? Keep improve

### 17th JAN => REBOOT THE REAL WORK

- just begin the work. The rest follows

### 18th JAN => SEE THE WORLD LIKE A POET AND AN ARTIST

- There is clarity (and joy) in seeing what others can’t see, in finding
grace and harmony in places others overlook. Isn’t that far better than
seeing the world as some dark place?

### 19th JANUARY => WHEREVER YOU GO, THERE YOUR CHOICE IS

- One thing will stay constant: our freedom of choice—both in the big picture and small picture.

### 20th JAN => REIGNITE YOUR THOUGHTS

- No matter what happens, no matter how disappointing our behavior has been in the past, 
the principles themselves remain unchanged. 
- We can return and embrace them at any moment. 
What happened yesterday — what happened five minutes ago — is the past. 
We can reignite and restart whenever we like.
...Why not do it right now?

### 21st JAN => A MORNING RITUAL

- Many successful people have a morning ritual. meditation, exercise, journaling—just a
few pages where they write down their thoughts, fears, hopes. In these
cases, the point is not so much the activity itself as it is the ritualized
reflection. The idea is to take some time to look inward and examine.

### 22nd JAN => THE DAY IN REVIEW

- Keep your own journal, whether it’s saved on a computer or in a little
notebook. Take time to consciously recall the events of the previous day. 
- Notice what contributed to your happiness
and what detracted from it. 
- Write down what you’d like to work on or
quotes that you like. By making the effort to record such thoughts, you’re
less likely to forget them. 
- An added bonus: you’ll have a running tally to
track your progress too.

### 23rd JAN => THE TRUTH ABOUT MONEY

### 24th JAN => PUSH FOR DEEP UNDERSTANDING

- "I learned to read carefully and not be satisfied
with a rough understanding of the whole, and not to agree too
quickly with those who have a lot to say about something."

### 25th JAN => THE ONLY PRIZE

- The more things we desire and the more we have to do to earn or attain
those achievements, the less we actually enjoy our lives—and the less free
we are.

<!-- ### 21th FEB => WISH NOT, WANT NOT

- When it comes to your goals and the things you strive for, ask yourself:
Am I in control of them or they in control of me?
 -->
