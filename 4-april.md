## Unbiased Thought

### 1st APRIL => THE COLOR OF YOUR THOUGHTS

- “Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in
thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions.”

### 2nd APRIL => BE WARY OF WHAT YOU LET IN

- We’ll inevitably be exposed to external influences at some point, no matter
how much we try to avoid them. 
- But we don't need to allow those influences to penetrate our minds. 
- We have the ability to put our guard up and decide what we actually allow in. 

- Uninvited guests might arrive at your home, but you don’t have to ask them to stay for
dinner.

### 3rd APRIL => DECEIVED AND DIVIDED

- Our internal war is usually a result of our conflicting desires.

### 4th APRIL => DON’T LET THIS GO TO YOUR HEAD

- When we experience success, we must make sure that it doesn’t change
us—that we continue to maintain our character despite the temptation not
to. Reason must lead the way no matter what good fortune comes along.

### 5th APRIL => TRUST, BUT VERIFY

- ASK QUESTIONS LIKE - Is this really so bad? What do I really know about this person? Why do I have
such strong feelings here? Is anxiety really adding much to the situation?
What’s so special about it?

### 6th APRIL => PREPARE YOURSELF FOR NEGATIVITY
- ... Maybe because you’ve prepared for it, you’ll
be able to act with patience, forgiveness, and understanding.

### 7th APRIL => EXPECT TO CHANGE YOUR OPINIONS
- We must fight our biases and preconceptions: because they
are a liabilities.
- Remember, if there is one core teaching at the heart of this philosophy,
it’s that we’re not as smart and as wise as we’d like to think we are. 
- If we ever do want to become wise, it comes from the questioning and from
humility — not, as many would like to think, from certainty, mistrust, and arrogance.

### 8th APRIL => THE COST OF ACCEPTING COUNTERFEITS

- “the first and greatest task of the
philosopher is to test and separate appearances, and to act on nothing that is
untested.”

### 9th APRIL => TEST YOUR IMPRESSIONS

- Part of Stoicism is cultivating the awareness that allows you to step back
and analyze your own senses, question their accuracy, and proceed only
with the positive and constructive ones.
- What feels right right now doesn’t
always stand up well over time. Hold your senses suspect. Again, trust, but
always verify.

### 10th APRIL => JUDGMENTS CAUSE DISTURBANCE

- “It isn’t events themselves that disturb people, but only their
judgments about them.”

### 11th APRIL => IF YOU WANT TO LEARN, BE HUMBLE

- “Throw out your conceited (excessively proud of oneself) opinions, 
for it is impossible for a person to begin to learn what he thinks he already knows.” 
- If you want to learn, if you want to improve your life, seeking out
teachers, philosophers, and great books is a good start. But this approach
will only be effective if you’re humble and ready to let go of opinions you
already have.

### 12th APRIL => REJECT TEMPTING GIFTS

- Our attraction toward what is new and shiny can lead us into serious trouble.

### 13th APRIL => LESS IS MORE

- “Don’t act grudgingly, selfishly, without due diligence, or to be a
contrarian. Don’t overdress your thought in fine language. Don’t
be a person of too many words and too many deeds. . . . Be
cheerful, not wanting outside help or the relief others might bring.
A person needs to stand on their own, not be propped up.”

### 14th APRIL => BECOMING AN EXPERT IN WHAT MATTERS

- “Believe me, it’s better to produce the balance-sheet of your own
life than that of the grain market.”

- At the end of your time on this planet, what expertise is going to be
more valuable — your understanding of matters of living and dying, or your
knowledge of the trending things ? 
- Which will help your children more — your
insight into happiness and meaning, or that you followed breaking political
news every day for thirty years ?

### 15th APRIL => PAY YOUR TAXES

- Everything we do has a toll attached to it.
- Waiting around is a tax on traveling. Rumors and gossip are the taxes that
come from acquiring a public persona. Disagreements and occasional
frustration are taxes placed on even the happiest of relationships. Theft is a
tax on abundance and having things that other people want. Stress and
problems are tariffs that come attached to success. And on and on and on.

### 16th APRIL => OBSERVE CAUSE AND EFFECT
- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy helps patients identify destructive patterns 
in their thoughts and behavior so they can, over time, direct and influence them 
in a more positive direction.
- Become an observer of your own thoughts and the actions those thoughts provoke.
- Where do they come from? What biases do they contain? Are they constructive or 
destructive? Do they cause you to make mistakes or engage in behavior you later regret? 
- Look for patterns; find where cause meets effect

### 17th APRIL => NO HARM, NO FOUL
- something said sarcastically differs drastically from something that was pointed and mean.
- The interpretation of a remark or a word has an immense amount of
power. It’s the difference between a laugh and hurt feelings. The difference
between a fight breaking out and two people connecting.
- If being upset or hurt is something you’d like to experience less often,
then make sure your interpretations of others’ words make that possible.
Choose the right inference from someone’s actions or from external events,
and it’s a lot more likely that you’ll have the right response.

### 18th APRIL => OPINIONS ARE LIKE
- Our opinion is often shaped by dogma (religious or cultural), entitlements, expectations, 
and in some cases, ignorance.
- But what if we let these opinions go? Let’s try weeding (ekkoptein; cutting or knocking out) them
out of our lives so that things simply are. Not good or bad, not colored with opinion or judgment.

### 19th APRIL => OUR SPHERE OF IMPULSES
- Be willing to learn from anyone and everyone, regardless of their station in life.

### 20th APRIL => REAL GOOD IS SIMPLE
- For centuries, people have assumed that wealth would be a wonderful
cure-all for their unhappiness or problems. Why else would they have
worked so hard for it? 
- But when people actually acquired the money and status they craved, 
they discovered it wasn’t quite what they had hoped. 
- The same is true of so many things we covet without really thinking.

### 21st APRIL => DON’T LET YOUR ATTENTION SLIDE
- “When you let your attention slide for a bit, don’t think you will get
back a grip on it whenever you wish—instead, bear in mind that
because of today’s mistake everything that follows will be
necessarily worse... 
- Is it possible to be free from error? Not by any means, but it is possible 
to be a person always stretching to avoid error.
- Attention matters— and in an era in which our attention is being fought  for by 
every new app, website, article, book, tweet, and post, its value has only gone up.
- You’ll never complete all your tasks if you allow yourself to be
distracted with every tiny interruption. 
- Your attention is one of your most critical resources. Don’t squander it!

### 22nd APRIL => THE MARKS OF A RATIONAL PERSON
- 1. First, we must look inward.
- 2. Next, we must examine ourselves critically.
- 3. Finally, we must make our own decisions — without restraint, biases or popular notions.

### 23rd APRIL => THE MIND IS ALL YOURS
- 1. The body can be severely damage by disease or injured or disabled in a sudden
accident. It can be imprisoned or subjected to torture. 
- 2. The breath can suddenly cease because our time has come, 
- or because someone has taken it from us.
- 3. But up until the very end, our mind is ours.

### 24th APRIL => A PRODUCTIVE USE FOR CONTEMPT

### 25th APRIL => THERE’S NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING WRONG
- Remember: you’re a free agent. When someone points out a legitimate
flaw in your belief or in your actions, they’re not criticizing you. They’re
presenting a better alternative. Accept it!

### 26th APRIL => THINGS HAPPEN IN TRAINING

### 27th APRIL => TURN IT INSIDE OUT
- By examining situations from the inside out, we can
be less daunted by them, less likely to be swayed by them.
- Dig into your fear of death or obscurity, and what will you find? Turn
some fancy ceremony inside out and you’ll find—what?

### 28th APRIL => WANTS MAKE YOU A SERVANT
- Taking the money, wanting the money — proverbially or
literally — makes you a servant to the people who have it.

### 29th APRIL => WASHING AWAY THE DUST OF LIFE
- Looking at the beautiful expanse (wide range) of the sky is an antidote to the 
constant pain, pettiness of earthly concerns (day to day problems / worries). 
- and it is good and sobering to lose yourself in that as often as you can.

### 30th APRIL => WHAT IS IN KEEPING WITH YOUR CHARACTER?
- Character is a powerful defense in a world that would love to be able to
seduce you, buy you, tempt you, and change you. 
- If you know what you believe and why you believe it, 
you’ll avoid poisonous relationships, toxic
jobs, fair-weather friends, and any number of ills that afflict people 
who haven’t thought through their deepest concerns. 
- That’s your education. That’s why you do this work.
